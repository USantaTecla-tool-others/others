The Sierpinski Triangles can be expressed by a rewrite system (L-system).

	 Variable: A B
	 Constants: + - 
	 Axiom (start value): A
	 Rule: A -> B-A-B
	 		 B -> A+B+A
	 		 angle : 60 deg
		 A and B mean draw forward (current direction)
		 + means turn left by angle, 
		 - means turn right by angle
